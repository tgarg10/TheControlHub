# Farm Monitoring Dashboard

## Introduction
Welcome to the Farm Monitoring Dashboard, a project developed for the Engineering Innovation Project. Our web application, powered by Django, HTML, JavaScript, and hosted on AWS Lightsail, enables real-time monitoring of an automatic farm while reporting essential statistics. To achieve this, we've integrated ESP32 camera Arduinos with Wi-Fi cards, AWS IoT, and an S3 bucket for seamless data collection and analysis.

## Features
+ Real-time Monitoring: View live camera feeds from ESP32 cameras placed throughout the farm.

+ Environmental Sensors: Access real-time data from environmental sensors, such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.

+ Statistical Reports: Generate and analyze statistics related to crop growth, climate conditions, and other farm metrics.

+ AWS Integration: Utilize AWS IoT to connect and manage ESP32 devices, and store images and sensor data in an S3 bucket for historical analysis.

+ User Dashboard: A user-friendly dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of farm conditions and historical data.

## Technology Stack
Our Farm Monitoring Dashboard harnesses a modern and robust technology stack:

+ Django: A Python web framework for the backend of the monitoring dashboard.

+ HTML/CSS: Frontend design and layout for visualizing farm data.

+ JavaScript: Enhancing user interaction and real-time updates.

+ AWS Lightsail: Hosting and infrastructure management for the web application.

+ ESP32 Camera Arduinos: Hardware for capturing live images from the farm.

+ Wi-Fi Cards: Enabling data transfer from ESP32 devices to the cloud.

+ AWS IoT: Managing device connections and data ingestion from ESP32 devices.

+ AWS S3 Bucket: Storing images and sensor data for historical analysis.
